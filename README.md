🌟 Roboshop Shell Scripts

Welcome to Roboshop Shell Scripts — a growing collection of automation scripts for Cloud & DevOps! 🚀
This repository is my hands-on playground where I write, test, and refine shell scripts to simplify tasks, manage infrastructure, and sharpen my scripting skills.

Think of it as a digital toolbox 🧰 that evolves day by day.

---------------------------------------------------------------

🧭 What’s Inside?

✅ Daily-use automation — small scripts that solve real problems.

✅ Cloud integration — AWS-focused scripts for provisioning, configuration, and monitoring.

✅ DevOps utilities — helpers for CI/CD pipelines, server setup, and container workflows.

✅ Learning experiments — new ideas and explorations in Bash, Linux, and cloud tools.
